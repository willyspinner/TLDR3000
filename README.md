Intelligently transform text-heavy fluffy web pages to more-readable summaries.


# TODO
- [ ] Implement custom self-hosted BART model
- [ ] trigger summarization using a hotkey / hotkey + select. Trigger on only select is annoying.
- [ ] Add small icon tooltip that users can click to summarize stuff.
- [ ] indicate summarized portions / textareas using some light shade. 
- [ ] add ability to revert back (on tooltip) after summarization
